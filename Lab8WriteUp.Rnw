\section{Introduction}
Lab 8 is a continuation of the work which we began during lab 7. In lab 7, we were tasked with computing the population moments for four distinct cases of the beta distribution and graphically comparing the different cases. In lab 8 we continued to build on our understanding of the beta distribution by modeling country death rates worldwide with the beta distribution. Our end goal with this lab was to be able to describe the beta distribution. Particularly, this write up aims to provide answers to questions such as: What is the beta distribution? What does it look like? What is it used for? What are its properties? And, what additional information do we gain from the simulations and real data analysis?  


\section{Density Functions and Parameters}
To begin, the beta distribution's probability density function (PDF) is given by: 
\[
f_X(x \mid \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta)} x^{\alpha-1} (1-x)^{\beta-1} I(x \in [0,1])
\]
This PDF is expressed using the gamma function and involves the random variable x along with parameters alpha and beta. The domain of the beta distribution is restricted to the interval [0,1], meaning $0 \leq x \leq 1$. Additionally, both shape parameters alpha and beta must be strictly positive for the distribution to be properly defined. 

\section{Properties}
During lab 7 multiple of our tasks saw us calculating certain properties of the beta distribution for our alternate alpha and beta values. Since the distributionâ€™s shape is defined by its parameters, the distributions properties, notably its mean, variance, skewness, and excess kurtosis are also described by the alpha and beta parameters. 

\indent 
Pictured below is a 2x2 grid of histograms depicting the respective distributions and density curves for the beta distribution with an alpha of 2, and a beta of 5. We iterated over this specific beta distribution 1000 times, each time generating 500 values for each property which we saved to a tibble and graphed below. We utilized the \texttt{patchwork} \citep{patchwork} library in order to orient the four graphs in this 2x2 grid fashion.
